# SOLID

- single responsibility principle
    - a class should only have one reason to change
    - _separation of concerns_ - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

- open-closed principle
    - classes should be open for extension and closed for modification

- liskov-substitution principle
    - you should be able to subsitute a base type for a subtype

- interface segregation principle
    - don't put too much into an interface
    - split it into separate interfaces
    - YAGNI - you ain't going to need it

- dependency inversion principle
    - high-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones
    - use abstraction
